#### Abstract
This research solved the Timetable creation problem, well-known as an NP-hard problem, with quantum annealing(QA).
We created a cost function set by users necessary for a timetable with Python.
As a result, we used cases of $2\times3$ shape table and found operating value with D-wave 2000.
